# 1. Module 1
## 1.1 Distributed systems (Hệ thống phân tán)
- is a collection of software components that are designed to work together even though they’re on separate servers.
- là một tập hợp các thành phần phần mềm được thiết kế để làm việc cùng nhau, ngay cả khi chúng đặt trên các máy chủ riêng biệt.

- A common example of a distributed system woulb be a website that contains:
  + Presentation logic
  + Business logic
  + Database engine
  + Web server

- Applications: are used in various applications, including cloud computing, web services, peer-to-peer networks, content delivery networks (CDNs), grid computing, and more.

- <i> Key takeaways: </i>
  + Definition: collaborate across separate servers, shared network.
 

## 1.2 NALSD
- Definition:
  + Non-abstract large system design
  + give SREs (site reliability engineers) the ability to access, design, and evaluate large systems.

- Two phrases:
  + Phase 1:
      * continuous refinement through feedback, prototyping, and feasibility studies.
      * Qúa trình lặp lại và liên tục hoàn thiện
  + Phase 2:
      * evaluates the system's feasibility and resilence at scale, considering how it will perform under significant load increases.

## 1.3 Built-In Libraries vs. External Libraries
  -  PyPI -- also known as the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org)
  -  In this module, we’re going to be transforming and converting images. To do that, we'll be using a popular library for image manipulation: the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The original PIL library hasn't been updated since 2009 and does not support Python 3. Fortunately, there's a current fork of PIL called Pillow, that properly supports Python 3 and is kept up-to-date. The Pillow library is packaged with the name pillow, but the module name in Python is still PIL.
>  ``` $ pip3 install pillow ```

## 1.4 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
